# Fcs_exam_part1
Build a small web app where users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks, with all data saved in the browser using localStorage.

Features to Implement:
Task List Display
Tasks appear in a list when the page loads (read from localStorage). Each task shows: text, status (done/not done), and buttons for edit/delete.
Add Task Form
Empty inputs should show an error message
Clicking "Edit" turns the task text into an input field + "Save" button.
Clicking "Delete" removes it from the DOM and from localStorage.
Mark as Complete, a checkbox or button toggles task completion.
Completed tasks should visually change (e.g., strike-through text, faded color).
Filters buttons for: "All", "Completed", "Pending".


Persist Data using localStorage so tasks remain after refreshing
